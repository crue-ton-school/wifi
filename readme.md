# Network Manager WiFi Interface

## Install
```sh
git clone https://github.com/crue-ton-school/wifi.git
cd wifi
sudo make install
```

You can also compile the program in the directory where you cloned it, by doing:
```sh
cd (repo directory)
sudo make local
```

## Uninstall
```sh
cd (repo directory)
sudo make uninstall
```

You can also pass "purge" which will remove the compiled wifi file where it was installed and get rid of the directory entirely
```sh
cd (repo directory)
sudo make purge
```
